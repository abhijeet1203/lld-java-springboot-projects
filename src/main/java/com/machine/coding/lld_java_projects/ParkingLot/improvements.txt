Improvements in parking lot system -

1. Add more interfaces for better abstraction (Services and Repositories) - IPREP-23
2. Enhance/scale the application for concurrency/multi-threading. - https://abhijeet-dev.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/IPREP/board?filter=&groupBy=status&selectedIssue=IPREP-23
3. Global error handling - IPREP-25
4. Authentication and Authorization using proper tokens - IPREP-26
5. Design patterns -

| Behavioral     | Strategy                | Valid                          | ✅ Already used at Fare / Slot allocation
|                | Observer                | Valid                          | Logging, notification on slot empty or filled, DB changes on some event
|                | Chain of Responsibility | Valid                          | For any sequential flow
|                | Command                 | Not valid for now              | Needed if system has queuing task, payment systems integration. May be needed once project is upgraded.
|                | State                   | Not valid for now              | Needed if want to switch between states, avoids if-else or switch

Multi-threading/Concurrency - 🎯 Must-Know
--------------------------------------------
1. Thread basics & safety – what is a thread, race condition, atomicity.
2. synchronized & volatile – how they ensure visibility & mutual exclusion.
3. Locks – ReentrantLock vs synchronized, when to use which.
4. Executor Framework – ExecutorService, submit(), Callable, Future.
5. Thread pools – fixed vs cached, why we use them.
6. Deadlock – what it is, how to prevent it (ordering locks / timeout).
7. wait/notify – basics of inter-thread communication.
